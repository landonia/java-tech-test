# Java Tech Test

Simple pojo based java test that will cover various aspects of pure java

To Solve:

PART 1
* What is the maximum time you would expect the test to run for?
* How long is it taking to run?
* Why is it taking longer than we expect?

PART 2
* We want an audit log when a customer is billed. This should print out the customers name, credit card number and the amount. We cannot modify the existing code.

PART 3
* The issue is that the current EZPayProvider is incorrect. The actual issue they were trying to solve is that only one unique credit card can be billed at the same time. Create a new provider that will ensure that the same credit card cannot be billed multiple times at the same time.
